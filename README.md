## Description

HireFlow is a minimal version (MVP) tool for managing candidates in the Frontend Developer recruitment process.

## Functionality

The application is based on Local Storage, which means:

- It remembers data within a single browser
- Data is stored locally (not sent to a server)
- Data remains available between sessions, as long as incognito mode is not used

## Use Case

An ideal solution for small recruitment teams needing a simple tool to track candidates in the recruitment process.
